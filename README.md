# TDD (Test-Driven Development)

## Introduction

### What is TDD?

- **Definition:** Test-Driven Development is a software development process where you write tests before writing the actual code.
- **Cycle:** Red (write a failing test), Green (write code to make the test pass), Refactor (clean up the code).

## Main Topics

### Benefits of TDD

- **Improved Code Quality:**
- **Refactoring with Confidence:**
- **Documentation:**
- **Improved Collaboration:**
- **Reduced Debugging Time:**
- **Efficiency and Productivity:**
- **Customer Satisfaction:**

### Key Concepts

- **Unit Tests vs. Integration Tests:**
  - Unit Tests: Focus on individual components.
  - Integration Tests: Verify the interaction between different components.
- **Mocks and Stubs:**
  - Mocks: Objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.
  - Stubs: Provide predetermined responses to calls made during the test.
- **Code Coverage:**
  - Measure of how much of the code is tested by the tests.
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**
  - The cycle of TDD.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):**
  - An extension of TDD that emphasizes writing tests in a natural language style to describe the behavior of the application.

### Example Workflow

- **Step 1:** Write a failing test (Red).
- **Step 2:** Write the minimum code to pass the test (Green).
- **Step 3:** Refactor the code to improve its structure (Refactor).
- **Step 4:** Repeat the cycle.

### Different Stages of a Test

- **Setup (Arrange)**
- **Execution (Act)**
- **Assertions (Assert)**
- **Teardown (Cleanup)**
- **Test Grouping and Organization**
